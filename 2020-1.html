 Directions (Q. Nos. 7-9) You have one
 brief passage with two questions
 following the passage. Read the passage
 carefully and choose the best answer to
 each question out of the given four
 alternatives.
 Some people believe that they are
 masters of their own fate. Other people
 see themselves as pawns of fats,
 believing that what happens to them in
 their lives is due to luck or chance.
 The first type, those who believe that
 they control their destinies, have been
 labelled internals, whereas the latter,
 who see their lives as being controlled by
 outside forces, have been called
 externals.
 Internals search more actively for
 information before making a decision,
 are more motivated to achieve, and
 make a greater attempt to control their
 environment. Externals, however, are
 more compliant and willing to follow
 directions. Therefore, internals do well
 on sophisticated tasks which include
 most, managerial and professional jobs
 that require complex information
 processing and learning.
 In addition, internals are more suited to
 jobs that require initiative and
 independence of action. Almost all
 successful sales people, for instance are
 internals. In contrast, externals should
 do well on jobs that are well structured
 and routine and in which success
 depends heavily on complying with the
 directions of others. <br>

 correct?
 <pre>
(a) Internals have more confidence

 8. Which one of these is correct?
 <pre>
(a) Internals seek jobs which call for
 more initiative
(b) Internals seek jobs which are
 full of fun and enjoyment
(c) Internals believe in receiving guidance and direction from superiors only
(d) Internals believe in destiny
<p></p></pre>

 9. Externals perceive themselves
 <pre>
 (a) as having little control overorganisational outcome
(b) as critical to the success of the
 organisation
(c) as those who can influence sales
 volumes
 (d) as those who search frantically
 for more information
