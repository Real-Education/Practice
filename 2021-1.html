 <h2><center>2021-2</center></h2>
  DIRECTION(Q1 and Q2. )Passage:  Read the following passage carefully and answerthe questions that follow.
    The first step for us is to realise that a city need not be a frustrater of life; it can be among other things, a mechanism for enhancing life, for producing possibilities of living which are not to be realised except through cities. But, for that to happen, deliberate and drastic planning is needed. Towns as much as animals, must have their systems of
    organs-those for transport and circulation are an obvious example. What we need now are organ systems for recreation, leisure, culture and community expression. This means abundance of open space,
    easy access to unspoilt nature, beauty
    in parks and in fine buildings,gymnasia and swimming baths and recreation grounds in plenty, central spaces for celebrations and demonstrations, halls for citizens’ meetings, concert halls and theatres and cinemas that belong to the city. And the buildings must not be built anyhow or dumped down anywhere; both they and their groupings should mean something important to the people of the place.
