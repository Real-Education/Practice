    DIRECTIONS (Qs. 16-20):Read the following passage and answer
    the following questions:
    
    The most important reason for this state of affairs is that India was the only country in the world to truly recognise the achievements of the Soviet Union-rather than merely focus on the debilitating faults that Communism brought to its people. The people of India realised that the achievement of one hundred percent literacy in a country much, much larger than its own and with similarly complicated ethnic and religious groupings, the rapid industrialization of a nation that was a primarily agrarian society when the Bolshevik revolution took place in 1917, the attendant revolutionary steps in science and technology, the accessibility of health care (primeval according to Western standards, perhaps, but not according to Indian ones) to the general population, and despite prohibition of the government of the time the vast
    
    outpourings in literature, music, art, etc. are momentous and remarkable feats in any country.
    In contrast, all that the West focused on were the massive human rights violations by the Soviet State on its people, the deliberate uprooting and mass migrations of ethnic peoples from one part of the country to another in the name of industrialization, the end of religion. In short, all the tools of information were employed to condemn the ideology of Communism, so much at variance with capitalist thinking. The difference with the Indian perception, I think here is, that while the Indians reacted as negatively to what the Soviet governments did to its people in the name of good governance (witness the imprisonment of Boris Pasternak and the formation of an international committee to put pressure for his release with Jawaharlal Nehru at its head), they took the pain  notto condemn the people of that broad country in black and whiteterms; they understood that mingled in the shades of grey weregrains of uniqueness (The Russians have never failed that characteristic in themselves; they have twice experimented with completely different ideologies, Communism and Capitalism both in the space of a century).
    <br>

    the passage?
    <pre>
    (a) India focused on the weak faults of Russian policies and system.
    (b) India seriously commended the achievement of Russia,i.e., 100% per cent literacy and rapid industrialization.
    (c) The process of industrialization had already startedwhen Russian revolution took place in 1917.
    (d) The literature, art and music received a setback during the communist regime in Russia.
    <p> (b) India seriously commended the achievement of Russia,i.e., 100% per cent literacy and rapid industrialization.</p></pre>
    17. The West did not pay heed to:
    <pre>
    (a) Rapid growth of nuclear weapons in Russia
    (b) Massive human rights violation by the Soviet state
    on its people
    (c) Planned uprooting and mass migration of ethnic people
    in the name of industrialization.
    (d) Both b and c

DIRECTION (Qs. 11-13): Read the following passage and answer
the following questions: <br>
At this stage of civilisation, when many nations are brought in to
close and vital contact for good and evil, it is important, as never
before, that their gross ignorance of one another should be
diminished, that they should begin to understand a little of one
another's historical experience and resulting mentality. It is the
fault of the English to expect the people of other countries to react
as they do, to political and international situations.

Our goodwill and good intentions are often brought to nothing,
because we expect other people to be like us. This would be
corrected if we knew the history, not necessarily in detail but in
broad outlines, of the social and political conditions which have
given to each nation its present character. <br>
