1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the question given below it. <br>
Over four hundred years after Michelangelo’s death, scholars are still unravelling the mysteries of his art. 
One mystery revealed recently was that, his famous painting of a pensive Cleopatra included a hidden 
drawing of a different Cleopatra on the reverse side. This hidden Cleopatra depicts a tormented woman, 
whose eyes stare out at the viewer and whose mouth is open, screaming in horror. The two images, drawn 
on two sides of the same paper, can be viewed simultaneously. The second mystery is with regard to 
Michelangelo’s architectural plan for the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Did he intend the dome to 
look like the model he built between 1558 and 1561? Or did he change his mind after building the model and 
decided to elevate the dome in the way it is today? Scholars do not agree on the answers. The third mystery 
about this great artist was why he destroyed hundreds or thousands of his drawings before he died. Did he 
feel that they were unimportant or did he want the world to see only his finished products? The mystery 
associated with Michelangelo’s art being elusive, has attracted artists, scholars and researchers since ages.
